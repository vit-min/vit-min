# **Digital patient-support platform**

### A project by @min Foundation

@min Foundation is established to enhance and support technological innovations and digital solutions addressing unmet patients&#39; needs and improving patients journey. The digital solutions are tailored to the individual specifics of the chronic conditions and are co-created with the involvement of the relevant patients groups.

**vit@min** will be designed in close collaboration with variety of experts, entities and institutions as needed for each concrete patients&#39; population. Namely but not only: National patients&#39; organization, Digital healthcare innovations cluster, unions of healthcare specialists, representatives of Bulgarian medical council, Bulgarian medicines verification organization, Bulgarian drugs agency, National healthcare institute, Bulgarian pharmaceutical union and others.

## 1. Situational analysis

Despite the progress in treatment of chronic diseases, a **serious problem** remains the **patient adherence** to drug regimen. According to large clinical trials , compliance rate to long-term medication therapies is 40%-50% while compliance with lifestyle changes is 20%-30%.

Furthermore, the rates of non-compliance with different types of treatment also differ greatly. More than 20 studies published in the past few years found that compliance with oral medication for type 2 diabetes mellitus ranged from 65% to 85%.

If the patients do not follow or adhere to the treatment plan faithfully, the intended beneficial effects of even the most carefully and scientifically-based treatment plan will not be realized.

Certain factors, amongst which the so called &quot;_ **patient-related factors** _&quot; turn out to be key in determining this contemporary tendency .

The significance of those factors is supported by statistics and conclusions of trials proving the profit and _ **improved patient outcome** _ if they are managed better by the patient.

An important role in this process takes _ **patients&#39; participation** _ in making decisions concerning prescribed medication therapy. Also respecting patients right to express opinion and seek for their **feedback** strengthens the relation physician-patient which is crucial for relevant adherence and treatment success.

The feedback itself appears to be the most important factor that helps the physicians determine if the right drug regimen is prescribed for his patient, personalize it and modify it accordingly.

Considering the dynamic and accelerated rate of our everyday life and less time that healthcare specialists have for their patients, new, consistent with the specific needs way to approach this serious problem is needed.

In partnership with digital innovations, technological advancement in medical field as well as in patients care and pharmaceutical industry, new solutions are attainable and achieving better results in managing adherence to treatment is possible.

## 2. Objectives of the project

The objective of the current proposal is to develope a simple, reliable, affordable and easy-to-use digital tool to support patients and their needs related to @herence to therapies.

The @herence to therapies tool will be the basis for further development of the digital patients support platform vit@min. that will provide number of innovative digital @ons to support patients, their health and care professionals, industry and decision makers through the complex patient&#39;s journey

The @herence to therapies tool aims:

- **To improve the prognosis and the quality of life** of patients with chronic diseases by enhancing patient treatment adherence and improving the treatment outcomes;
- **To reduce the patients` disease burden** by automating complex or routine procedures, which are often the leading factor for treatment failure.
- **To collect real-world patients` reported data** by providing technological support for capturing in real time the medicines intake
- **To empower patients for better adherence to therapies** by an intelligent and adaptable system of reminders, automatic calls, adherence advices, and when needed, direct contact via specialized call-center and/or HCP.
- **To increase understanding about adherence failure** by structured capturing of treatment adherence data, identification of common patterns or failure factors
- **To increase the treatment outcomes for patients and the health and care systems**
- **To demonstrate the added value of the digital patients&#39; tools** based on patients&#39; needs and meaningful patients&#39; involvement
- **To identify and prioritize the urgent and/or most needed digital modules to be added to the patients support platform vit@min**** :** e-prescription; e-access to clinical trials; automation of e-documentation and procedures to reduce administrative burden; patients-doctor communication module; patient-patient communication and networks; doctor-doctor communication modules; e-training and e-learning tools and resources for patients, doctors, care givers and families; e-tools for patient reported outcomes, real world evidences and other data to support decision makers when introducing evidence based policies or other needed digital solutions.

## 3. Project governance and involvement of key target groups

The pilot phase of the project will focus on 2 up to 4 chronic conditions: Diabetes and Chronic Myeloid Leukemia as a start, and HIV or other chronic condition if needed for diversification of funding and exploring different scenarios of disease management. This will allow the project teams to have better understanding of the specific needs of each patient population and their health and care professionals as well as selecting the right digital solutions for each of groups.

Each chronic condition will have a multi-stakeholder advisory body which will be responsible for the planning, development, implementation, testing and dissemination of the concrete digital solution. This will guarantee that the solutions will not only be based on needs, but will increase the added value for all players involved in the disease management:

- **Patients and those who take care for them**
- **Health and care professionals, representing the multi-disciplinary and the hoolistic approach**
- **IT specialists and developers**
- **Health institutions, decision and policy makers**
- **Pharmaceutical industry, not in providing vital funds only, but with their expertise in developing and providing the innovation to patients most in need**
- **Other experts as needed for the concrete patient population**

## 4. Idea description and its elements

The platform will be interactive, complex and represented by two start modules- a drug module and a patient module, integrated together as a mobile application.

1. **Drug module-** a database for the medications used in a certain chronic condition- individually applied or in a combination with other drug. To each drug used by the patient a related and important information from the summary of product characteristics will be included- route of administration, precautions, needed interval between meals, interactions.

Drug to drug interactions, undersirable effects, adverse reactions will be set as a &quot;high-priority&quot; information for the patient to access in terms of making **reports directly** to Bulgarian drugs agency (BDA).

Reports will be executed using an implemented report system from panel on the patient module in the application.

Also, instructions to guide the patient through the steps needed to get a protocol for a drug will be included- documents, additional appointments to other specialists, laboratory tests.

Environmental factors that may alter the drug effects will be added so therapeutic concentrations would be reached- co-administration with other drugs, drinks or food slowing drug absorption etc.

1. **Patient module** will consists of several panels, developed in the most _ **accessible user interface** _ for a patient as a mobile application free of charge for the patient (iOS &amp; Android).

The UI of Vit@min will be suitable for the needs of the specific group of patient and their technical literacy.

The user friendly interface will serve as a base for building up and maintaining a high patient compliance. The accent will be on the notification system which will effectively remind the patient about an incoming drug intake or a skipped one in a non-consuming time manner .

**The notification system** will complement the verification and compliance reports-generating systems.

A patient will be able to modify the time for drug administration in his personal month calendar and add data on his diet as well as comorbidity and related to his/her drugs. This information will be compared to the one in the drug module and warnings about drug to drug or food to drug interactions will be generated shown in the notification panel (_ **personalization system** _).

To ease the process of patient data accumulation (comorbidity, harmful habits, drugs intake) and reduce the possibility of errors,a pilot elaboration of a communication channel will integrate and link the scattered medical records between the different medical centers, hospitals and the mobile application as a **personal medical dossier**.

In this way, all the information for the patient will be accessible to him without being able to edit it and provide it by his meaning to physicians and other hospital wards on admission.

Every time a patient takes his prescribed medicine, a confirmation will be required in order to generate an adequate compliance reports and respectively better patient outcome ( **verification system** ).

By the patient will stick to his treatment and avoid skipping doses or overdosing.

_ **A refill system** _ _will alert the patients for the amount of residual drug_ bycalculating the remaining tablets using an algorithm set in the system. The date for buying a new pack of the drug will be set according to the algorithm and the opening of the pack so a dose won&#39;t be skipped.

**Compliance reports** will be generated automatically using the gathered information of daily intakes in the end of the month or weekly.

**A personal calendar** will be available for the patient to set up incoming appointments to the doctor and plan them up according to the date of protocol expiry and need of additional lab tests or examinations.

Logistic errors will be avoided as the application will compare the information entered by the patient into the protocol dates which information will be calculated by the algorithms for expiration and renewal.

**Access to FAQ** section about the disease, recommendations and factors that the patient can influence will be granted in order to improve patients&#39; health literacy.

Detailed information on possible adverse reactions or undesirable effects will be available on general information concerning the patient so they would be recognized on time and reported to the physician

All of the information available for the patient will be integrated in an individual patients&#39; profile and will be accessible for the physician and the hospital. In this way, unnecessary documentation carried by the patient will be available in one place and systematized. Furthermore, modifications of the medication plan of the patient will be carried out easier and more adequately by the physician so therapeutical goals would be reached.
